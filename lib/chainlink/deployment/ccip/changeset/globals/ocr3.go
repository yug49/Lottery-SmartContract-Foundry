// Intention of this file is to be a single source of the truth for OCR3 parameters used by CCIP plugins.
//
// Assumptions:
//   - Although, some values are similar between Commit and Execute, we should keep them separate, because
//     these plugins have different requirements and characteristics. This way we can avoid misconfiguration
//     by accidentally changing parameter for one plugin while adjusting it for the other
//   - OCR3 parameters are chain agnostic and should be reused across different chains. There might be some use cases
//     for overrides to accommodate specific chain characteristics (e.g. Ethereum).
//     However, for most of the cases we should strive to rely on defaults under CommitOCRParams and ExecOCRParams.
//     This makes the testing process much easier and increase our confidence that the configuration is safe to use.
//   - The fewer overrides the better. Introducing new overrides should be done with caution and only if there's a strong
//     justification for it. Moreover, it requires detailed chaos / load testing to ensure that the new parameters are safe to use
//     and meet CCIP SLOs
//   - Single params must not be stored under const or exposed outside of this file to limit the risk of
//     accidental configuration or partial configuration
//   - MaxDurations should be set on the latencies observed on various environments using p99 OCR3 latencies
//     These values should be specific to the plugin type and should not depend on the chain family
//     or the environment in which plugin runs
