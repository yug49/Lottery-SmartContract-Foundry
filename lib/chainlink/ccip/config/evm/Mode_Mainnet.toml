# The formula for FeeCap is (current block base fee * (1.125 ^ EIP1559FeeCapBufferBlocks) + tipcap)
# where tipcap is managed by the block history estimators. In the context of CCIP,
# the gas price is relayed to other changes for quotes so we want accurate/avg not pessimistic values.
# So we set this to zero so FeeCap = baseFee + tipcap.
