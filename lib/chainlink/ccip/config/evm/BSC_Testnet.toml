# BSC uses Clique consensus with ~3s block times
# Clique offers finality within (N/2)+1 blocks where N is number of signers
# There are 21 BSC validators so theoretically finality should occur after 21/2+1 = 11 blocks
ChainID = '97'
# Keeping this >> 11 because it's not expensive and gives us a safety margin
