# Workflow is triggered daily midnight UTC
# A PR with more than 60 days of inactivity will be marked as stale
# A PR that's stale for more than 7 days will be automatically closed
# Issues are exempt from auto marking as stale but issues with manually added 'stale' label are eligible for auto closure after 7 days.
# PRs with `exempt-pr-labels` or assignees are exempt from auto stale marking, it's the responsibility of the assignee to get the PR progressed either with review/merge or closure.
